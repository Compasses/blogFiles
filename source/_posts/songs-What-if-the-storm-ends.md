And I don't see you
As you are now
Ever again
The perfect halo
Of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against
The planets last dance
Just for a minute
The silver-forked sky
Lift you up like a star
That I will follow
But now it's found us
Like I have found you
I don't wanna run
Just overwhelm me

What if the storm ends?
It leaves us nothing
Except the memory
A distant echo
I won't pin down
I've walked unsettled
Rattle cage after cage
Until my blood boils
I wanna see you
As you are now
Every single day
That I am living
Painted in flames
A peeling thunder
Be the lightning in me
That strikes relentless

What if the storm ends?
And I don't see you
As you are now
Ever again
The perfect halo
Of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against
The planets last dance
Just for a minute
The silver-forked sky
Lifts you up like a star
That I will follow
But now it's found us
Like I have found you
I don't wanna run
Just overwhelm me
